# Guidion Programming Test

Hello there kind person. Welcome to a small test of your abilities.

## How to submit your results

1. Create a fork of this repo
2. Make the code compile at least
3. Tell us when you're ready, and we'll have a look at your code

Note: If you don't have a git account, feel free to do this on bitbucket too. If 
you don't want the code public, send an email with your source code in zip.

## What we want you to do

This repo has a piece of code which is broken. It doesn't currently compile, and 
we want it to work. The requirements are as follows:

- As a User, I want to be able to have a custom layout of some information from 
  an account
- The layout needs to show me the account I'm wanting to view, with the 
  following details: Name, Phone Number, and the parents account name if the 
  account has a parent.
- If the name of the account is "Testing", the phone number should display the 
  value "123123" because this should be the phone number of the account.

## What you can submit

You can change this whole thing if you want. So long as it meets the 
requirements, you can achieve this however you want, even write the whole code 
from scratch and implement it entirely again how you would like to. Don't spend 
too long on this though, even if your code is a proof of concept, it'll still 
show us how you think. We do expect you to follow Salesforce Best Practises of 
course.

## Hints

This code base is booby trapped. If something doesn't make sense, it was
designed to confuse you.

Best practise means you write test coverage right?

Note: If you're successful in the interview process, you will never see code
like this in our production.
